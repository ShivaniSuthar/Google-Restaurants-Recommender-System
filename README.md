Developed a model to predict average restaurant ratings based on written reviews, image count, and sentiment analysis.
Analyzed a dataset with review texts, ratings, and images using Python (NLTK for sentiment analysis, Pandas for data wrangling). Implemented ridge regression, XGBoost, ngrams, logistic regression, naive bayes, and KNN models, testing various model regularization parameters. 
Identified XGBoost as the top-performing model with an MSE of 0.204.
